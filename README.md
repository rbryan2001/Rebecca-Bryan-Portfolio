# Rebecca-Bryan-Portfolio
This is a collection of projects I have completed at the University of Montana, either through coursework or employment at the Math learning Center. 

1. **BMIS 482 Big Data Project**

   Throughout BMIS 482, students work in cross-disciplinary teams to complete big data projects from different disciplines,       with an  emphasis on agile project management.
   
   In Spring 2024, I worked with a small team of students to build a public health dashboard using CDC Chronic Disease            Indicator data for policy evaluation, in partnership with Morton Analytics through the UM College of Business' Big Data        Project/Project Management course. We were tasked with documenting our planning and progress through the following             documents included in this portfolio:
      - Change Management Plan
      - Communications Plan
      - Research Plan
      - Risk Management Plan
      - Scope Management Plan
      - System Documents
      - Team Charter
      - Technology Plan
      - Project Progress Report
      - Final Project Report

2. **CSCI 591 Computational Cognitive Neuroscience**

   Throughout CSCI 591, students learn computational neuroscience techniques and methods by applying the concepts with hands-on training and focus on 'open science' practices that enable scientists to effectively document and share their research.
      - Final paper: Mind the Gap (In Resolution): Assessing the Impact of MRI Slice Resolution on the Clinical Applicability of Lesion Mapping Models
      - Final presentation: Graduate Final Presentation 

4. **MLC Design Portfolio**

   In Fall 2023, I was tasked with revamping the signage for the Math Learning Center at the University of Montana. Included      are three examples of my work for that project.

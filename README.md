# Rebecca-Bryan-Portfolio
This is a collection of notes, homework assignments, and projects that I've completed in my courses at the University of Montana. The courses include Data Science Analytics, Theoretical Basics of Big Data Analysis, and Numerical Analysis. 

Please note that this is a work in progress and for now is only notebooks I've created for classes. I will upload personal projects as I have time to complete them.

# Rebecca-Bryan-Portfolio
This is a collection of notes, homework assignments, and projects that I've completed in my courses at the University of Montana. The courses currently include BMIS 482 - Big Data Project and CSCI 591 - Computational Cognitive Neuroscience.

This repository is a work in progress, more will be added soon.
